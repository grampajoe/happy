Quickly set up and tear down Heroku apps!

Quickly starting
----------------

Add an `app.json manifest`_
that looks kinda like this:

.. code:: json

  {
    "name": "My App Thing",
    "repository": "https://github.com/helloitsme/thingy",
    "env": {
      "FROBULATION_LIMIT": {
        "description": "Maximum frobulations per lunar cycle.",
        "value": "7"
      }
    },
    "addons": [
      "pusher"
    ]
  }

Push that to your thing's ``master`` branch on GitHub so Heroku can find it.

Log in with the `Heroku toolbelt`_ , then do this:

.. code:: text

  $ pip install happy
  $ happy up butt-man-123
  Creating app... butt-man-123
  Building... done
  It's up! :) https://butt-man-123.herokuapp.com

That's it! You made a temporary app with all the fixins, which you can
use to continuously integrate or whatever you want to do.

Then, you can get rid of it like:

.. code:: text

  $ happy down butt-man-123
  Are you sure you want to delete butt-man-123? [y/N]: y
  Destroying app butt-man-123... done
  It's down. :(

Commands
--------

up
~~

Usage: ``happy up [OPTIONS] [APP_NAME]``

Brings up a Heroku app.

The app name is stored in a file called ``.happy`` in the working directory so
happy can find it later.

- ``APP_NAME``

  (optional) Name of the Heroku app to create. If this is not given, one is
  chosen for you by the Heroku API.

- ``--auth-token``

  (optional) Heroku API auth token. If this is not given, happy assumes you're
  logged in through Heroku CLI, i.e. your token is stored in your ``netrc``
  file.

- ``--env``

  (optional) Environment variable overrides, e.g. ``--env KEY=value``. For
  multiple variables, this option can be passed more than once. Variable names
  MUST match one of the names in the ``env`` section of your ``app.json``, or
  the build will fail with an ``invalid app.json`` message.

- ``--tarball-url``

  (optional) URL of the tarball containing app.json. If this is not given,
  happy tries to infer it from an ``app.json`` file in the current directory.

down
~~~~

Usage: ``happy down [OPTIONS] [APP_NAME]``

Brings down a Heroku app.

- ``APP_NAME``

  (optional) Name of the Heroku app to delete. If this is not given, the app
  name is read from a file called ``.happy`` in the working directory.

- ``--auth-token``

  (optional) Heroku API auth token. If this is not given, happy assumes you're
  logged in through Heroku CLI, i.e. your token is stored in your ``netrc``
  file.

- ``--force``

  (optional) Suppress the delete confirmation prompt. Useful for automation!

Running the tests
-----------------

1. Install tox_ with ``pip install tox``.
2. Run the tests with ``tox``.
